# Roblox-Trade-Manager

Shows list of RAP and value data for most recent trades. Default trades it shows is 10 although it can be configured by setting a limit parameter on the `get_trades_list` function. The manager can show the rap win amount and the value win amount with colors to indicate whether or not the trade is a win or a loss. The trade manager also flags projected items with a yellow triangle.
